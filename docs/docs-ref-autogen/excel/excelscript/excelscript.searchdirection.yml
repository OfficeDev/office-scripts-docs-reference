  /**
   * This script searches for the next instance of the text "TK" on the current worksheet.
   * It then selects that cell and removes "TK" and all formatting from the cell.
   */
  function main(workbook: ExcelScript.Workbook) {
    // Get the used range on the current worksheet.
    let range = workbook.getActiveWorksheet().getUsedRange();

    // Get the next cell that contains "TK".
    let tkCell = range.find("TK", {
      completeMatch: true, /* Don't match if the cell text only contains "TK" as part of another string. */
      matchCase: false,
      searchDirection: ExcelScript.SearchDirection.forward /* Start at the beginning of the range and go to later columns and rows. */
    });

    // Set focus on the found cell.
    tkCell.select();

    // Remove the "TK" text value from the cell, as well as any formatting that may have been added.
    tkCell.clear(ExcelScript.ClearApplyTo.all);
