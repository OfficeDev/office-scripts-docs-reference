    // Get cell C3 in the current worksheet.
    const sheet = workbook.getActiveWorksheet();
    const cell = sheet.getRange("C3");

    // Create a diamond that slightly overlaps the cell C3.
    const diamond = sheet.addGeometricShape(ExcelScript.GeometricShapeType.diamond);
    // Set each dimension so that the shape extends 5 pixels beyond the cell borders.
    diamond.setLeft(cell.getLeft() - 5);
    diamond.setTop(cell.getTop() - 5);
    diamond.setHeight(cell.getHeight() + 10);
    diamond.setWidth(cell.getWidth() + 10);
