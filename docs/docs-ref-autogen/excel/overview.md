## Common classes

The following list breaks down the basics of the Office Scripts object model. This shows the common classes and how they relate to one another.

- A [Workbook](/javascript/api/office-scripts/excelscript/excelscript.workbook) contains one or more [Worksheets](/javascript/api/office-scripts/excelscript/excelscript.worksheet).
- A [Worksheet](/javascript/api/office-scripts/excelscript/excelscript.worksheet) gives access to cells through [Range](/javascript/api/office-scripts/excelscript/excelscript.range) objects.
- A [Range](/javascript/api/office-scripts/excelscript/excelscript.range) represents a group of contiguous cells.
- [Ranges](/javascript/api/office-scripts/excelscript/excelscript.range) are used to create and place [Tables](/javascript/api/office-scripts/excelscript/excelscript.table), [Charts](/javascript/api/office-scripts/excelscript/excelscript.chart), [Shapes](/javascript/api/office-scripts/excelscript/excelscript.shape), and other data visualization or organization objects.
- A [Worksheet](/javascript/api/office-scripts/excelscript/excelscript.worksheet) contains arrays filled with those objects that are present in the individual sheet.
- A [Workbook](/javascript/api/office-scripts/excelscript/excelscript.workbook) contains arrays of some of those data objects for the entire Workbook.
