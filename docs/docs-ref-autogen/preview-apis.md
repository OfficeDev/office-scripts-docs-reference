# Office Scripts preview APIs

New Office Scripts APIs are first introduced in "preview", and then later released to general availability after sufficient testing occurs and user feedback is acquired.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Preview APIs are subject to change and are not intended for use in a production environment. We recommend that you try them out in test and development environments only. Do not use preview APIs in a production environment or within business-critical documents.

The following table provides a concise summary of the APIs, while the subsequent [API list](#api-list) table gives a detailed list.
