# Office Scripts preview APIs

New Office Scripts APIs are first introduced in "preview", and then later released to general availability after sufficient testing occurs and user feedback is acquired.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Preview APIs are subject to change and are not intended for use in a production environment. We recommend that you try them out in test and development environments only. Do not use preview APIs in a production environment or within business-critical documents.

## API list

Office Scripts APIs use two namespaces: `OfficeScript` for APIs that are not connected to an Excel workbook, and `ExcelScript` for APIs that work with Excel workbooks. Currently, the only preview APIs are in the `OfficeScript` namespace. The following section lists those APIs.

### OfficeScript namespace

> [!NOTE]
> There are currently no APIs in preview.
